# MissingValueImputation
Source code for the paper "Missing Value Imputation by Density-based Distance Likelihood". This implementation is on top of the publicly released code (https://github.com/DLMImputation/DLM) of the method in the paper: Shaoxu Song and Yu Sun, "Imputing Various Incomplete Attributes via Distance likelihood," the 26th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, p. 535-545, Virtual Event, CA, USA, August 23-27, 2020.


##Input
Sample input data is in directory "/data". d

#Output
The predicted values of the missed attribute values of the incomplete records.
